# Hi, I'm rich-sykes 👋

I'm a Quantitative Developer and Cloud Engineer working at the intersection of data, automation, and scalable architecture. I specialize in designing and deploying credit risk systems in the cloud, with deep experience in:

- ☁️ Azure (Container Apps, Function Apps, SQL, DevOps)
- 🧠 Python for modeling, APIs, and automation
- 🔁 CI/CD pipelines with ADO, test coverage, and security checks
- 🔍 TDD and clean software architecture


My career spans industries from automotive engineering to banking, and my GitHub is where I share open-source tools, experiments, and automation scripts that reflect my approach to clean, scalable, and secure development.
