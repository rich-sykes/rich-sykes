# Rich Sykes

I'm a Senior Quantitative Developer and Cloud Engineer with a unique career path spanning automotive engineering, analytics and financial services. I have built high-performance, scalable systems for risk modelling, emissions optimization, and statistical analysis — always with a focus on automation, testability, and reliability.

### 🚀 What I Do
- **Cloud Architecture** – Designed and deployed a cloud native platform for hosting credit risk models at Investec Bank  using Azure Container Apps, Azure Function Apps, and  Azure SQL.
- **CI/CD & DevOps** – Built robust Azure DevOps pipelines including unit testing (PyTest), code coverage, vulnerability scanning (Wiz/Dependabot), and deployment automation.
- **TDD-First Engineering** – Advocate of clean, test-driven development to maintain software quality in lean teams without dedicated QA or BAs.
- **Model Deployment** – Automated model pipelines across Python and R, with experience in scaling parallelized optimization tasks in both finance and engineering domains.
